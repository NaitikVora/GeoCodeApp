# GeoCodeAppFinal
A C#.NET project with interactive GUI that easily geocodes human read-able addresses into respective lat,longs and plot marker 
accordingly, and much more ..

I have created this project with the help of my mentors from IT industry and they approve of it.

What it basically does is that you can enter any location and the google maps API helps to resolve addresses into lat,longs 
and plot markers accordingly. 

Then there is also a feature to upload an excel file that contains lat,longs that is already geocoded and plots all of them onto 
the GMaps. And much more ..

Just another IT geek tyrna make it :)
